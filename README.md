# hunters-among-speedrunners-client-pack

A client side modpack for playing [ZymSB's Hunters among Speedrunners datapack](https://github.com/zymsbgt/hunters-among-speedrunners)

Along with Curseforge and Modrinth formatted releases, we now have a Packwiz version. This means that the modpack will be automatically managed and updated, and will have proper optional mod support. Optional mods will remove the need for the Lite edition, so it will be discontinued The Packwiz version is compatible with MultiMC (and its forks like PolyMC and ManyMC) and ATLauncher.

## Install instructions
